# Mapping Earthquakes and Tectonic Plates

## Project Overview 

A map of earthquakes that happened in the past seven days was developed with the use of Leaflet.js API, GeoJSON data from a USG website. Earthquakes with a mangnitude higher than 4.5 are represented with a circle of certain color, and the larger the magnitude, the larger the circle is. The legend can be found in the lower right corner. Each earthquake marker has a popup marker with addiitonal information. Users can choose from 4 different types of maps to view: street, satellite, outdoor and dark, and 3 different layers: earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquakes.
